			<p id="Sushi">You’ve probably realized by now you have many kinds of sushi to choose among. The California roll, which originated in Los Angeles in the 1960s, is a kind of maki sushi. That means you make California rolls (and other sushi recipes that fall into the same category) by rolling it in a bamboo mat with nori, or seaweed. This recipe from Natasha’s Kitchen takes about 80 minutes, including the time it takes to cook the rice.</p>
